ATARI ST Emulator 2 Go

Goal of this project is to implement a complete, portable Atari 1040 ST emulator written in Go.

## Project Status
Currently this project is in an early design phase of the 68K cpu emulator. 
Motorola'S 68K is a CISC cpu with 8 different addressing modes and 3 operand sizes (8bit byte, 16bit word, 32bit long). 
Using Go's language features and design patterns, I want to reduce the boilerplate code to the minimum before implementing the
instruction set.
