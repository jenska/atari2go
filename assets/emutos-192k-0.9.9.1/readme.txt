EmuTOS - 192 KB versions

These ROMs are suitable for the following hardware:
- ST / STf
- Mega ST
- emulators of the above

Unlike other ROM versions, they do NOT autodetect extra hardware, and might not
work on machines with additional hardware. For example, they don't work under
the Hatari emulator's Falcon emulation due to missing VIDEL support.

Each ROM contains a single language:

etos192cz.img - Czech (PAL)
etos192de.img - German (PAL)
etos192es.img - Spanish (PAL)
etos192fi.img - Finnish (PAL)
etos192fr.img - French (PAL)
etos192gr.img - Greek (PAL)
etos192it.img - Italian (PAL)
etos192no.img - Norwegian (PAL)
etos192ru.img - Russian (PAL)
etos192se.img - Swedish (PAL)
etos192sg.img - Swiss German (PAL)
etos192us.img - English (NTSC)
etos192uk.img - English (PAL)

The following optional files are also supplied:
emucurs.rsc - modifiable mouse cursors for the AES/desktop
emucurs.def - definition file for the above
emuicon.rsc - contains additional icons for the desktop
emuicon.def - definition file for the above

Note that the emuicon.rsc file format differs from deskicon.rsc used by later
versions of the Atari TOS desktop.

Note that selecting Norwegian/Swedish currently sets the language to English,
but the keyboard layout to Norwegian/Swedish.

Due to size limitations, the 192 KB ROMs contains:
- no EmuCON

Since EmuTOS 0.9.1, the 192 KB ROMs contain the same desktop as other variants.

These ROM images have been built using:
make all192

This release has been built on Windows/Cygwin, using
Vincent Rivi√®re's GCC 4.6.4 cross-compiler.  The custom tools used in
the build process were built with native GCC 6.4.0.
